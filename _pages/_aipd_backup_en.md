Long-term engagement in research within the **AI for Green Pesticide Discovery**. Addressing bottlenecks such as the high difficulty, cost, and long cycles of green pesticide creation, I conduct AI-driven research on efficient, low-toxicity, and eco-friendly green pesticides. My research focuses on the four-in-one collaborative theory of "Expert Wisdom + General AI + Specialized AI + Wet Lab Robot," building a full-chain dry-wet closed-loop intelligent green pesticide discovery platform to significantly improve the success rate and efficiency of creation. Related work has been published as the lead author in journals such as [Nature Machine Intelligence](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00501-8) and Advanced Science. Current research interests include:  
- AI Foundations: Multi-agent systems, Large Language Models (LLMs), Molecular representation learning  
- Plant Protection: De novo design of small molecules/peptides/RNAi/nanopesticides, Smart genomic breeding, Pest/weed target discovery, Synthesis planning   

**Networking**: Eager to establish connections with experts to spark new ideas (Phone/WeChat: 18297126075).  

**Call for Papers**: Welcome to contact me for submissions to Innovation/Exploration/iMeta journals; high-quality manuscripts can be arranged for a fast-track publication process.  

[**Recruiting**](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/discovery/item/68f60c6f0000000004013c00): Recruiting Masters/PhDs/Joint students/Interns. I provide introductory training upon enrollment, detailed guidance throughout the process, and abundant computing resources to try and help every student publish a First Author Q1 paper. Outstanding students will receive full support for publishing in sub-journals.
